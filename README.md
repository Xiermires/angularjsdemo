# angularjsdemo
A little demo mixing angularjs / vert.x / JPA (H2)

Created using Maven, Eclipse Luna, Java 8.

Persistance is set to 'drop-and-create', it takes place so far the process is alive.

To use, either import into Eclipse and run src/main/java as an application, or use 'mvn package' to create the .jar && dependencies in the target/ folder and run it via 'java -jar angularjs-demo...jar', then open 'localhost:8080' in your browser.
